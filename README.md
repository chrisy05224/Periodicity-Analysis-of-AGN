# Periodicity-Analysis-of-AGN
This repository houses the Python implementation of some of the methods described in the paper “Systematic Search for γ-Ray Periodicity in Active Galactic Nuclei Detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope” by Peñil, et al.

The Discrete Fourier Transform uses Welch's method, an extension of the Fourier Transform that deals with noisy data, to make a periodogram. Below is an example of the periodogram generated by DFT, using data from PG 1553+113. The code for the Discrete Fourier Transform is in the file DFT.py.

The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is another extension of the Fourier Transform, which also deals with uneven data. Similarly to the DFT, it also generates a periodogram. Below is an example of the periodogram generated by Lomb Scargle using data from PG 1553+113. The code for this is in the file LombScargleBootstrap.py.

Phase Dispersion Minimization is a fitting technique which returns the model with the lowest scatter compared to the data. Below is an example of the output graph produced by PDM using data from PG 1553+113. The code for this is in the file PDM.py.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sinusoidal Fitting is a technique which uses random walkers to maximize the likeliness of the fitting model to the data. Below is an example of the output graph produced by MCMC using data from PG 1553+113. The code for this is in the file MCMC.py.

In addition, the file Information.txt has some extra information on the usage of the methods.
Main.py gives an example of how to incorporate these four methods into one coherent pipeline.
