# Periodicity-Analysis-of-AGN
This repository houses the Python implementation of some of the methods described in the paper “Systematic Search for γ-Ray Periodicity in Active Galactic Nuclei Detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope” by Peñil, et al.

The Discrete Fourier Transform uses Welch's method to determine the periodogram, which is a
